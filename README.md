## Project Status

| Item | Status |
|------|--------|
| Project Phase | Sprint 0 – Foundation |
| Current Version | v0.1.0 |
| Development Status | Active Development |
| License | Apache License 2.0 |

KnowledgeFlow is currently in the engineering foundation phase. The primary objective of Sprint 0 is to establish a scalable architecture, engineering standards, documentation, and development environment before implementation begins.

---

## Overview

Organizations generate thousands of documents every year, including regulations, policies, contracts, reports, meeting minutes, manuals, and other institutional knowledge. Unfortunately, much of this knowledge becomes difficult to discover and reuse.

KnowledgeFlow addresses this challenge by transforming organizational documents into trusted, structured, searchable, and AI-ready knowledge.

The platform automatically ingests documents from multiple sources, extracts text using Optical Character Recognition (OCR), enriches documents with intelligent metadata, stores semantic representations in a vector database, and enables natural language search through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

KnowledgeFlow is designed with enterprise scalability, maintainability, and cloud-native architecture in mind.

---

## Vision

To become a next-generation Enterprise Knowledge Intelligence Platform that enables organizations to transform documents into trusted intelligence.

---

## Design Philosophy

KnowledgeFlow is built around several engineering principles.

- Architecture before implementation
- Documentation before coding
- Metadata before AI
- API First
- Incremental Processing
- Security by Design
- Open Standards
- Cloud Agnostic
- Open Source First
- Simplicity over complexity

Every architectural decision is documented and versioned to ensure long-term maintainability.

The repository follows a modular architecture where each directory has a single, well-defined responsibility.

---

## Documentation

KnowledgeFlow follows a documentation-first engineering approach.

Project documentation includes:

- Project Charter
- Engineering Handbook
- Architecture Decision Records (ADR)
- System Architecture
- Database Design
- API Specification
- Deployment Guide
- Operations Manual
- Security Guidelines

Documentation is treated as part of the software architecture rather than supplementary material.

## Project Goals

KnowledgeFlow aims to become an extensible Enterprise Knowledge Intelligence Platform capable of serving universities, enterprises, government agencies, and research institutions.

Primary goals include:

- Enterprise document management
- AI-powered knowledge retrieval
- Intelligent metadata generation
- Semantic enterprise search
- Scalable architecture
- Cloud-native deployment
- Open architecture

---

## Non-Goals

KnowledgeFlow is not intended to become:
